- This program provides the implementation of our unsupervised node embedding model SANNE as described in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12100) whose central idea is to employ a transformer self-attention network to iteratively aggregate vector representations of nodes in sampled random walks. 
- SANNE is also used in an inductive setting to infer embeddings of new/unseen nodes adding to a given graph.

## Usage

### News

- June 08: Update Pytorch (1.5.0) implementation. You should change to the `log_uniform` directory to perform `make` to build `SampledSoftmax`, and then add the `log_uniform` directory to your PYTHONPATH.
- March 25: The Tensorflow implementation was completed one year ago and now it is out-of-date, caused by the change of Tensorflow from 1.x to 2.x. I will release the Pytorch implementation soon.

### Requirements
- Python 3
- Pytorch 1.5 or 
- Tensorflow 1.6 and Tensor2Tensor 1.9
- scikit-learn

### Training

Examples for the Pytorch implementation:

	$ python train_pytorch_SANNE.py --dataset cora --batch_size 64 --num_self_att_layers 2 --num_heads 2 --ff_hidden_size 256 --num_neighbors 4 --walk_length 8 --num_walks 32 --learning_rate 0.005 --model_name CORA_trans_att2_h2_nw32_lr0.005
	
	$ python train_pytorch_SANNE_inductive.py --dataset cora --batch_size 64 --num_self_att_layers 2 --num_heads 2 --ff_hidden_size 256 --num_neighbors 4 --walk_length 8 --num_walks 32 --fold_idx 1 --learning_rate 0.005 --model_name CORA_ind_att2_h2_nw32_fold1_lr0.005
